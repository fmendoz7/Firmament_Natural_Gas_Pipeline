# Firmament Application: Natural Gas Pipeline

This project is a demonstration of a byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism overlay and formal verification guard checks to ensure the security of a natural gas pipeline between mutually distrusting parties. 

This system prevents the reachability of unsafe states (ie: Gas Siphoning Attack, Natural Gas Plant Explosion, etc.) by any natural gas plant in the byzantine system. The repo contains the simulations, modeled in Matlab, Simulink, and Stateflow, for both initially insecure and revised secure SLSX Models of open-source Russia-EU-Ukrain natural gas pipeline, with supporting literature attached below. 

The full explanation and process is within the attached papers- most notably; "Detecting Security Leaks In Hybrid Systems with Information Flow Analysis" by Nguyen et al.
